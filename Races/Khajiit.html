			<h1> Khajiit </h1>
			
			<h3 id="KhajiitText">
						Khajiit are cat-like people who come from Elsweyr, known for high intelligence and agility. These traits make them very good thieves and acrobats, but Khajiit are also fearsome warriors. Magic does not come easily to Khajiit, and requires strenuous training.[citation needed] Khajiit mostly stay on land, but piracy and skooma trade does draw some to work as sailors.
						Khajiit anatomy differs greatly from both men and elves, not only because of their fur, tail, and sometimes toe-walking stance, but also their digestive system and metabolism. Khajiit, Argonians, and Imga are the so-called "beast races" of Tamriel because of these large differences. Khajiit have a lifespan similar to that of humans. There are no well-documented cases of cross-breeding between Khajiit and other races, though there are rumors of such a thing. The foreign appearance and behavior of Khajiit make them common targets of racism.<br>
						Khajiit kingdoms existed long before recorded history. Elsweyr consisted of 16 kingdoms of about 20 different types of Khajiit early in the First Era, particularly 						cooperative and harmonious compared to other races of the time. The Thrassian Plague upset this balance in 1E 2260, leaving only two primary kingdoms. Elsweyr became its modern state in 2E 309 when Keirgo of Anequina and Eshita of Pellitine combined their long-feuding domains and gave the land its name, sparking a serious class struggle, as the northern Anequina saw Pellitine as depraved and decadent, while the Khajiit of Pellitine thought Anequina barbarous.
						The Mane Rid-T'har-ri'Datta restored peace by having each side of Khajiiti society take turns governing the entire region based on the phases of Masser and Secunda, which Khajiit hold in great reverence. The terms of this measure, the Riddle'thar, were overseen by the thinly-veiled dictatorship of the Mane himself. The effictiveness of each individual Mane has varied greatly, and some led the Khajiit to periods of strife and war throughout the Third Era, especially with the Bosmer. They have historically achieved greater peace and prosperity under Imperial rule (according to Imperial scholars), yet often rebel against their authority in keeping with their unique view of the world.
						In 4E 98, Masser and Secunda vanished, creating fear and strife among the Khajiit. When the moons reappeared two years later and the Thalmor announced they had used magic to restore them, the Khajiit praised them as their saviors. In 4E 115, popular support for the Thalmor led to a military takeover of Elsweyr's Imperial government and the reestablishment of the ancient kingdoms Anequina and Pelletine, this time as states of the Thalmor.
