			<h1> Redguard </h1>

									Redguards are the most naturally talented warriors in Tamriel. The dark-skinned, wiry-haired men of Hammerfell seem born to battle, though their pride and fierce independence of spirit makes them more suitable as scouts or skirmishers, or as free-ranging heroes and adventurers, than as rank-and-file soldiers. In addition to their cultural affinities for many armor styles and weapons (particularly swords), Redguards are also physically blessed with hardy constitutions, resistance to poison, and quickness of foot.Redguards do not share the same blood as the other human races, and they have no known connection with the ancestral Nordic homeland of Atmora.<br><br>
									Redguards (formerly "Yokudans") hail from the western continent of Yokuda, which sank into the sea in ancient times. The cause of Yokuda's sinking is attributed either to natural factors (earthquakes, tsunamis, or volcanic eruptions) or to the revenge of a defeated band of Ansei called the Hiradirge. Upon the sinking of their homeland around 1E 792, the Yokudan fleet set sail to the east, eventually arriving in what would later be called Hammerfell. The bulk of the refugees remained on the island of Herne while the Ra Gada, the Warrior Wave, continued on to mainland Hammerfell in 1E 808.
									Imperial scholars concluded that the term "Redguard" originated as a phonetic corruption of "Ra Gada". However, Redguard myth considers it a legacy of the War of the Singers, a series of seven battles in Yokuda circa 1E 780, shortly before the continent was destroyed. Their legends say the war was fought between the army of the Last Emperor Hira and the greatly outnumbered Ansei (presumably the Hiradirge), who sought out the leadership of Lord Frandar Hunding at the onset. Hunding led the Ansei to victory using his "Hammer and the Anvil" strategy, but at great cost. Though they spared the land from Hira's tyranny, they had to leave it afterwards, for when Hunding's strategy reached fruition in the final battle (i.e., when the proverbial hammer fell), more than three hundred thousand people were killed. In the eyes of the citizenry, their guardians were red with blood. So they left Yokuda, sailing across the Eltheric Ocean, and took on new names to commemorate their final battle: their new land was Hammerfell, and their new name was the Redguards. As Yokuda sank into the sea, the Yokudans were forced to follow them to this new land or perish.
									These were not the first Redguards to arrive in Tamriel, however. The Horsemen of the Rivenspire region of High Rock, long a myth, were confirmed to exist by scholars in the Second Era. They are believed to have migrated there from the Yokudan island of Akos Kasaz sometime in the early sixth century of the First Era.
