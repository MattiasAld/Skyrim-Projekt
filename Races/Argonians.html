										<h4> 

										Every Province of Tamriel has its secret histories, but no land in the Empire is as undocumented and unexplored as Black Marsh. Bordering Morrowind to the north and Cyrodiil to the west, Black Marsh also known as Argonia is one of the most inhospitable locations in Tamriel. The watersoaked landscape gives way to them swamplands. Wich is teaming with flesheating insects, posionus poisonous and diseases. It has been calles the garbage heap of Tamriel. To where everything rotten and despoiled eventually flows. But for those resilient enough to live there, there is a dangerously alluring beauty to be found within its borders.<br><br>
										The original natives of Black Marsh and maybe even Tamriel are as mysterious as the province itself, thats because these ancient natives are a species of santian trees that grow in the heart of Argonia, The Hist. The Argonians will tell you that The Hist are more ancient than all the mortal races. Older than the repressive Elves, and surely older than the hot headed racism of men. The Hist has existed since time immemorial, and their connection with the Argonians runs deeper than any roots. Very little is known and even less is understood about the reptilian natives of Black Marsh. Years of defending their borders have made the Argonians experts at guerilla warfare. And their natural abilities make them equality at home underwater as on land. They are well suited for the treacherous swamps of their homeland and have developed natural immunities diseases and posiions.	They are in general a reserved people, slow to trust and hard to know. Yet they are fiercly loyal and will fight to the death for those they have named friend. While Argoninans appear reptilian in nature, they also exhibit qualities of fish and amphibians. They are able to breathe underwater through small gills behind their ears, and swim using the same method as a eel. Using their tails as a propeller. Argonian appearence ranges from reptilian to almost human, this is caused by the Hist sap they ingest wich takes place on their namingday.
