			<h1> Orsimer </h1>
			
			<h3 id="OrcText">
											Orcs, also called Orsimer or "Pariah Folk" in ancient times, are sophisticated, beastlike people of the Wrothgarian Mountains, Dragontail Mountains, and Orsinium (literally translated as "Orc-Town"). They are noted for their unshakable courage in war and their unflinching endurance of hardships. In the past, Orcs have been widely feared and hated by the other nations and races of Tamriel, and were often considered to be goblin-ken. However, they have slowly won acceptance in the Empire, in particular for their distinguished service in the Emperor's Legions. Orc armorers are prized for their craftsmanship, and Orc warriors in heavy armor are among the finest front-line troops in the Empire, and are fearsome when using their berserker rage. Orcs have a lifespan similar to that of humans. Most Imperial citizens regard the Orc society as rough and cruel. The Orcs of the Iliac Bay region have developed their own language, known as Orcish, and have often had their own kingdom, Orsinium.<br><br>
											The Orcs were supposedly created when the Daedric Prince Boethiah defeated the Aldmeri god Trinimac, transforming him into Malacath and his faithful, the Orsimer, into Orcs. When the transformation occurred is unclear, but Orcs have been inhabiting the Iliac Bay region since the early years of the First Era. Some reports say Orcs were in Morrowind acting as raiders and mercenaries as early as 1E 700. It is known that the Aldmer had already colonized the mainland of High Rock during the Merethic Era before Orcs emerged. They were viewed as a constant threat to the other races, especially after the Ra Gada drove many Orcs out of Hammerfell and greatly strengthened Orsinium. Several kingdoms banded together in High Rock and destroyed the first Orc kingdom in 1E 980. Without a home, prejudice against them was even greater.
											Many more Orsiniums appeared and disappeared after the first one. In the middle Second Era, Orsinium was controlled by the Daggerfall Covenant, and was given to Kurog gro-Bagrakh's clan as a reward for helping King Emeric defeat Ranser, the king of Shornhelm. Kurog then became the king of Orsinium, which subsequently joined the Second Daggerfall Covenant. Another incarnation, sometimes called Nova Orsinium, was created by Gortwog gro-Nagorm in 3E 399. He gathered enough power to force Emperor Uriel Septim VII to formally recognize Orsinium as an equal of the other lesser kingdoms of the Iliac Bay region. During the Warp in the West, Orsinium was one of the four kingdoms to gain control of the Numidium, conquering the surrounding kingdoms and baronies and swearing loyalty to the Emperor. Early in the Fourth Era, Orsinium was once again sacked by the Redguards and Bretons and presumably eliminated, and many Orc refugees were escorted to Skyrim by the Imperial Legion. The kingdom later re-formed in the mountains between Hammerfell and Skyrim.
