							<h1> Skyrim </h1>
							<h2 id="Center"> 
						    Skyrim, the northernmost province of Tamriel, is a cold and mountainous region also known as the Old Kingdom, Mereth, or the Fatherland. Many past battles have given it a ravaged appearance and many ruins. Though currently inhabited primarily by Nords, the Elves who they replaced had resided there since time immemorial. The sovereign, the High King of Skyrim, is chosen by the Moot, a convention of jarls. A jarl is a regional ruler chosen through heredity and, rarely, through right of arms.The High King typically rules until death, though acts of dishonor, particularly the appearance of cowardice, can lead to the recall and reconsideration of the Moot. Since the Pact of Chieftains was signed in 1E 420, the Moot does not give serious consideration to anyone but the High King's direct heir unless one is not available.

						   		<h1> History</h1>
						   	<h2> Skyrim's history is mostly that of the Nords. The Nords believe the sky, Kyne, breathed life into them at the summit of the Throat of the World, which is now considered the tallest mountain in Tamriel (the Red Mountain was acknowledged as the tallest before its eruption during the Red Year).
							The many mountain ranges in and around the province resulted from unknown cataclysms in the Dawn Era. The only known relic from this time is the Skyforge, an ancient, powerful, and still-active forge built into the living rock in modern-day Whiterun. Who built it remains a mystery, but the Elves feared it, and this led the invading Atmorans to claim it for themselves.
							The Aldmer and Snow Elves occupied Skyrim until the late Merethic Era, when the final wave of Nordic immigration, led by Ysgramor, finally established Nordic supremacy in modern-day Skyrim. Settlers from Atmora crossed the Sea of Ghosts and made landfall here many times, often clashing with those who had already established themselves. They often lived in harmony with the Aldmer, though they sometimes clashed.
							Ysgramor's clan expanded their territory, and it continued to expand and contract by winning and losing territories in Morrowind and High Rock during the First Era. Elven rule of Skyrim is thought to have ended under the reign of King Harald (1E 143 - 1E 221). However, the Dwemer remained in their underground cities and in massive underground caverns like Blackreach, while on the surface pockets of Snow Elves hid away in the wilderness. The Nords often tried to battle with the Dwemer, but rarely had any success. When the Dwemer disappeared around 1E 700, they left behind the Falmer, Snow Elves who they had allowed to take refuge with them and then twisted into rebellious slave monsters. They remained under the ground, occasionally making forays to the surface and creating legends amongst the Nords of their presence and malevolent intent.
							After the assassination of High King Logrolf in 2E 431, a dispute over the succession resulted in Skyrim's division into two independent kingdoms. It began when Jarl Svartr of Solitude challenged the legitimacy of Logrolf's heir, Freydis, and a Moot was convened. Although Freydis was accepted by the Crown of Verity, a magical artifact crafted to test the worthiness of potential rulers of Skyrim, and named High Queen in Windhelm, a partial Moot held in Solitude declared Svartr to be High King. From then on, Skyrim was divided into an Eastern kingdom, which consisted of the holds of the Rift, Eastmarch, the Pale and Winterhold and was ruled by the successors of Freydis, and a Western kingdom, ruled by the successors of Svartr and containing the holds of Falkreath, Whiterun, Hjaalmarch and Haafingar. This schism persisted at least until the time of the Alliance War in 2E 582. At that time, the Reach did not belong to either kingdom, being ruled by the Reachmen under the Despot of Markarth instead.
							Orc strongholds dot the wilderness; many Orcs were escorted into Skyrim by the Imperial Legion following the sacking of Orsinium in the early Fourth Era. Besides the Orcs, the Elven population has also increased due to the Red Year of 4E 5, when natural disasters in Morrowind sent many Dunmer fleeing into eastern Skyrim. Following the Great War, Thalmor officials hunted for and persecuted Talos worshippers, thus bringing some small measure of Elven rule back to Skyrim. While these smaller creatures vied for dominance over the millennia, the giants have been largely ignored (and often protected by law).
